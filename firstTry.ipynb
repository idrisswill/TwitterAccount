    "\"Next conference in San Francisco this week, the official announcement could come as early as tomorrow. \"\\\n",
    "\"Reached by phone, Kaggle co-founder CEO Anthony Goldbloom declined to deny that the acquisition is happening. \"\\\n",
    "\"Google itself declined 'to comment on rumors'. Kaggle, which has about half a million data scientists on its platform, \"\\\n",
    "\"was founded by Goldbloom  and Ben Hamner in 2010. \"\\\n",
    "\"The service got an early start and even though it has a few competitors like DrivenData, TopCoder and HackerRank, \"\\\n",
    "\"it has managed to stay well ahead of them by focusing on its specific niche. \"\\\n",

    "\"and 'kernels', too. On Kaggle, kernels are basically the source code for analyzing data sets and developers can \"\\\n",

    "\"Like similar competition-centric sites, Kaggle also runs a job board, too. It's unclear what Google will do with \"\\\n",
